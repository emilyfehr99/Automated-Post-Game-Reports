## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Built-in Safeguards
- **Position Limits**: Maximum 10% of portfolio per trade (configurable)
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only recommend trades above minimum confidence
- **Liquidity Requirements**: Minimum liquidity thresholds
- **Time Decay**: Risk increases as markets approach expiration
- **Diversification**: Spread risk across multiple markets

### Risk Factors
- **Market Risk**: Prediction markets are inherently risky
- **Liquidity Risk**: Low liquidity markets may be difficult to exit
- **Time Risk**: Markets closer to expiration are more volatile
- **Model Risk**: AI predictions are not guaranteed
- **Regulatory Risk**: Legal restrictions may apply

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No events found"**:
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Polymarket API is accessible
   - Try again in a few minutes

2. **"Error fetching exchange rate"**:
   - Internet connection required for real-time rates
   - System will use cached rate as fallback

3. **"Insufficient training data"**:
   - Normal for new installations
   - Model will improve with more data over time

4. **Web interface not loading**:
   - Ensure Streamlit is installed: `pip install streamlit`
   - Check if port 8501 is available
   - Try: `streamlit run polymarket_web_interface.py --server.port 8502`

### Performance Optimization

- **Reduce API calls**: Increase cache duration in config
- **Limit events**: Reduce number of events analyzed
- **Batch processing**: Process recommendations in batches
