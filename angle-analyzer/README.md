## Quick Start

### Option 1: Direct File Opening
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser:
```bash
open index.html
```

### Option 2: Local Web Server
For better performance and to avoid CORS issues:

#### Using Python (recommended):
```bash
cd angle-analyzer
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

#### Using Node.js:
```bash
cd angle-analyzer
npx http-server
```

#### Using PHP:
```bash
cd angle-analyzer
php -S localhost:8000
```

## How to Use

### Image Analysis Tab
1. **Upload Image**: Click "Choose Image" and select an image file
2. **Measure Angle**: Click two points on the image:
   - First click: Start point of the line
   - Second click: End point of the line
3. **View Result**: The angle will be displayed in degrees relative to horizontal (0¬∞)
4. **Reset**: Click "Reset" or press 'R' to start a new measurement

### Video Analysis Tab
1. **Upload Video**: Click "Choose Video" and select a video file
2. **Control Playback**: Use the video controls to navigate through the video
3. **Select Drawing Tool**: Choose from Line, Angle, Freehand, or Eraser tools
4. **Draw on Video**: Click and drag to draw annotations on the video frame

## Features in Detail

### Angle Calculation
The app uses vector mathematics to calculate angles:
1. Creates vectors from the vertex to each endpoint
2. Calculates the dot product of the vectors
3. Uses the arccosine function to determine the angle
4. Converts from radians to degrees

### Visual Enhancements
- Numbered points for easy identification
- Colored lines showing the measured angle
- Arc indicator at the vertex
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Loading indicators for image processing

### Responsive Design
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices
- Optimized canvas sizing for various viewports

## Troubleshooting

### Image Not Loading
- Ensure the image file is a supported format (PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP)
- Check that the file isn't corrupted
- Try a different image file

### Canvas Not Responding
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

### Angle Calculation Issues
- Make sure you click exactly 3 points
- Points should be distinct (not overlapping)
- The vertex (middle point) should be the corner of the angle you want to measure
