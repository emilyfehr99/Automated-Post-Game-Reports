## üîç Current Model Analysis

### What We Have Now:
```python
def _calculate_expected_goals(self, x_coord, y_coord, zone, shot_type, event_type):
    # Distance-based xG (4 tiers: <20ft, 20-35ft, 35-50ft, >50ft)
    # Angle adjustment (4 tiers: 0-15¬∞, 15-30¬∞, 30-45¬∞, >45¬∞)
    # Zone multiplier (O=1.5/1.2/0.8, N=0.3, D=0.1)
    # Shot type multiplier
    # Event type multiplier (shot-on-goal=1.0, miss=0.7, block=0.5)
```

### Strengths:
‚úÖ Simple and interpretable  
‚úÖ Uses distance and angle  
‚úÖ Accounts for shot type  
‚úÖ Fast to compute  

### Weaknesses:
‚ùå Not trained on actual data (arbitrary multipliers)  
‚ùå No rebound detection  
‚ùå No rush detection  
‚ùå No strength state differentiation (5v5, PP, PK)  
‚ùå No time-based factors  
‚ùå Coarse distance/angle bins  
‚ùå No score state consideration

## üí° Improvement Ideas (Feasibility Ranking)

### üü¢ HIGH PRIORITY (Easy & High Impact):

1. **Data-Driven Baseline Model**
   - Scrape historical NHL data (2019-2024)
   - Create grid-based baseline like Hockey-Statistics
   - Calculate actual FSh% (Fenwick Shooting %) per location
   - **Impact:** Major - replaces arbitrary multipliers with real data
   - **Effort:** Medium - need to build data collection pipeline

2. **Rebound Detection**
   - Identify shots within 2-3 seconds of previous shot
   - Apply ~2√ó multiplier (backed by research)
   - **Impact:** High - rebounds are much more dangerous
   - **Effort:** Low - just need to track previous event timing

3. **Rush Shot Detection**
   - Identify shots within 4 seconds of neutral/defensive zone event
   - Apply ~1.7√ó multiplier
   - **Impact:** High - rush chances are dangerous
   - **Effort:** Low - track event zones and timing

4. **Strength State Differentiation**
   - Build separate models for 5v5, 4v4, 3v3, 5v4, 5v3, 4v5
   - Power play shots are more dangerous
   - **Impact:** High - different game states have very different scoring rates
   - **Effort:** Medium - need to parse situationCode properly

5. **Improved Distance/Angle Calculation**
   - Use continuous values instead of bins
   - Use actual shooting percentage curves from data
   - **Impact:** Medium-High - more accurate location modeling
   - **Effort:** Low - just refine existing calculation

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY (Moderate Effort, Good Impact):

6. **Score State Adjustment**
   - Teams play differently when leading/trailing
   - Apply multipliers based on goal differential
   - **Impact:** Medium - affects shot quality
   - **Effort:** Low - just need to track game score

7. **Shot Type Refinements**
   - Use data-driven multipliers from historical data
   - Currently using arbitrary values
   - **Impact:** Medium - shot types matter
   - **Effort:** Medium - need to analyze historical shot types

8. **Time Since Last Event**
   - Quick shots after events can catch goalies out of position
   - Different from rebounds (any event, not just shots)
   - **Impact:** Medium - goalie positioning matters
   - **Effort:** Low - track all event timing

9. **Angle Change Detection**
   - Compare shot location to previous event location
   - Large angle changes challenge goalies
   - **Impact:** Medium - lateral movement is hard for goalies
   - **Effort:** Medium - need to track previous event coordinates

10. **Period/Time Effects**
    - Scoring rates may vary by period or game time
    - Fatigue effects in 3rd period
    - **Impact:** Low-Medium - small effect
    - **Effort:** Low - just add period/time variables

### üî¥ LOW PRIORITY (High Effort or Low Impact):

11. **Pre-Shot Movement Detection**
    - Track sequences of events leading to shot
    - Passing sequences, carries, etc.
    - **Impact:** Medium - but hard to model without tracking data
    - **Effort:** High - complex sequence modeling

12. **Rink Bias Adjustment**
    - Some arenas have measurement biases
    - **Impact:** Low - small effect
    - **Effort:** Medium - need to model each arena

13. **Season Trends**
    - Rules changes, equipment changes over time
    - **Impact:** Low - we're focused on recent data
    - **Effort:** Low - just add season variable

14. **Player Shooting Skill**
    - DON'T include in xG model (by design)
    - xG should be quality of chance, not shooter
    - Use for GAx (Goals Above xG) calculations instead
    - **Impact:** N/A - intentionally excluded
    - **Effort:** N/A

    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_grid = self.load_baseline()  # FSh% per location
        self.adjustments = self.load_adjustments()  # Multipliers
    
    def calculate_xg(self, shot_data):
        # 1. Get baseline from location
        base_xg = self.get_baseline_xg(shot_data['x'], shot_data['y'], 
                                        shot_data['strength_state'])
        
        # 2. Apply adjustments
        rebound_adj = self.get_rebound_adjustment(shot_data, previous_events)
        rush_adj = self.get_rush_adjustment(shot_data, previous_events)
        shot_type_adj = self.get_shot_type_adjustment(shot_data['shot_type'])
        score_adj = self.get_score_adjustment(shot_data['score_differential'])
        
        # 3. Combine
        final_xg = base_xg * rebound_adj * rush_adj * shot_type_adj * score_adj
        
        return min(final_xg, 0.95)  # Cap at 95%
```

## üöß Challenges & Limitations

1. **Data Quality:** NHL API has some errors/inconsistencies
2. **Historical Data:** May need to handle different API versions over time
3. **Computation Time:** Grid-based lookup should be fast, but need to test at scale
4. **Model Complexity:** Balance between accuracy and interpretability
5. **No Tracking Data:** Can't model player positions, traffic, etc.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

1. **Brainstorm Review** ‚Üê WE ARE HERE
2. Get user approval on approach
3. Start Phase 1: Data collection
4. Build prototype
5. Test and iterate

**Question for User:** 
- Which phases should we prioritize?
- Should we start with Phase 1 (data collection) or implement quick wins (rebounds, rushes) first?
- Any specific features you want prioritized?
